## Motivation

Swift's randomness API is powerful and simple to use, but static and limited. While it goes beyond random numbers and can generate random booleans, shuffle and pluck random elements from collections, it goes no further and provides no means for extensibility. Gen is a lightweight wrapper over Swift's randomness APIs that makes it easy to build custom generators of any kind of value.

## Examples

Gen's namesake type, `Gen`, is responsible for producing random values.

``` swift
Gen.bool
// Gen<Bool>
```

Every random function that comes with Swift is also available as a function on `Gen`.

``` swift
Int.random(in: 1...10) // 4
Gen.int(in: 1...10) // Gen<Int>
```

Rather than immediately produce a random value, `Gen` describes a random value that can be produced by calling its `run` method.

``` swift
Gen.int(in: 1...10).run() // 2
```

It's precisely this 

Gen's main building block of randomness is the `Gen` type, which is generic over the random values it can generate. `Gen` values 

## Installation

### Carthage

If you use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), you can add the following dependency to your `Cartfile`:

``` ruby
github "pointfreeco/swift-gen" ~> 0.1
```

### CocoaPods

If your project uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), just add the following to your `Podfile`:

``` ruby
pod 'Gen', '~> 0.1'
```

### SwiftPM

If you want to use Gen in a project that uses [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/), it's as simple as adding a `dependencies` clause to your `Package.swift`:

``` swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-gen.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

### Xcode Sub-project

Submodule, clone, or download Gen, and drag `Gen.xcodeproj` into your project.
